# Engineering Practices Demo

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot engineering practices demo! Here we're going to get comfortable with the professional tools and features in GitHub Copilot. We'll start in the VS Code IDE and then move to github.com for additional collaboration features.

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this demo, you will:
- [ ] Understand how to debug and inspect Copilot interactions
- [ ] Know how to export and import agent debug sessions
- [ ] Be familiar with system prompts and their importance
- [ ] Understand collaboration features on GitHub.com

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

## 🔧 IDE Features

GitHub Copilot has many features designed to help engineering teams understand AI decision-making and collaborate effectively on code generation.

### 🐛 Step 1: Inspect Copilot Interactions

**Why this matters:** Understanding how Copilot makes suggestions helps you write better prompts and trust the AI's recommendations.

#### Method 1: Using the Command Palette
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)
2. Type "Developer: Show Chat Debug View"
3. Select **"Developer: Show Chat Debug View"**

#### Method 2: Using the Chat View
1. Open the **Chat** view
2. Select the overflow menu (**...**)
3. Select **"Show Chat Debug View"**

#### What You'll See
Once the debug panel opens, you can explore:
- **System prompt:** Background instructions given to Copilot
- **User prompt:** The actual prompt sent to the AI
- **Context:** Files, symbols, and other information sent with the request
- **Response:** The raw response returned by the model
- **Tool responses:** Inputs and outputs for tools used during the interaction

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use this when Copilot's suggestions seem unexpected - you can see exactly what context it's using!

### 💬 Step 2: Export and Import Agent Debug Sessions

**Why this matters:** Exporting a debug session lets teammates inspect the same prompts, context, tool calls, and errors when troubleshooting agent behavior.

#### Open the Agent Debug Logs

1. Open VS Code settings and enable `github.copilot.chat.agentDebugLog.fileLogging.enabled`
2. Open the **Chat** view
3. Select the overflow menu (**...**)
4. Select **"Show Agent Debug Logs"**

#### Export a Debug Session

1. In the Agent Debug Logs panel, select the session you want to export
2. Select the **Export** icon in the top-right toolbar
3. Save the OpenTelemetry JSON file

#### Import a Debug Session

1. Open the Agent Debug Logs panel
2. Select the **Import** icon in the top-right toolbar
3. Select a previously exported JSON file

**Use case:** Import a teammate's debug session to reproduce and diagnose agent behavior without relying on screenshots or recollection.

## 🌐 GitHub.com Collaboration Features

GitHub.com provides additional tools for managing Copilot at the organizational level and sharing knowledge across teams.

### 🎛️ Step 3: Explore Prompts

**Why this matters:** Prompts define how Copilot behaves across your organization. Understanding these helps ensure consistent, high-quality code generation that follows your team's standards.

#### Personal Instructions
1. **Navigate to GitHub Copilot:** Go to [https://github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot)
2. **Access settings:** Click on your user icon on the bottom-left corner
3. **Open personal instructions:** Select **"Personal instructions"**
4. **Add in instructions:** You can add customize guidelines into how Copilot responds to your prompts

#### What to Explore
- **Personal instructions:** Are there any preferences you'd like in the instructions? Test it out!

### 🤝 Step 4: Manage Shared Conversations

**Why this matters:** Shared conversations create a knowledge base of effective AI interactions that your entire team can learn from and build upon.

#### Share a Conversation
1. **Navigate to GitHub Copilot:** Go to [https://github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot)
2. **Start a chat:** Start a conversation. In the chat window, type the following prompt:
   ```markdown
   What are the advantages of the Go programming language?
   ```
3. **Share the conversation:** Click the **"Share"** button at the top-right of the chat window
4. **Select share:** Select share and copy the link to share with your team

#### View Shared Conversation
1. **Navigate to GitHub Copilot:** Go to [https://github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot)
2. **Access sharing options:** Click on your user icon on the bottom-left corner
3. **Open conversation management:** Select **"Manage shared conversations"**

#### What to Explore with Shared Conversations
- **Shared Conversations:** Browse conversations shared by your team
- **Categories:** See how conversations are organized by topic
- **Usage Patterns:** Notice which types of conversations are shared most often

**💼 Best Practices for Sharing:**
- Share conversations that solved complex problems
- Include context about when and why certain approaches work
- Tag conversations with relevant keywords for easy discovery
